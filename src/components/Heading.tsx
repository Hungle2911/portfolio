        I'm a full-stack developer based out of Toronto, Ontario. Having
        recently completed a comprehensive web development bootcamp, I aspire to
        work on projects that tackle real-world challenges. My goal is to
        contribute to innovative solutions that make a positive impact on
        society, whether through improving healthcare systems, enhancing
        environmental sustainability, or increasing access to education through
        technology.
