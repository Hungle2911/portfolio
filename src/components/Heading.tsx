        Having recently completed a comprehensive web development bootcamp, I
        have acquired skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, among
        other technologies. I aspire to work on projects that tackle real-world
        challenges. My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that make a
        positive impact on society, whether through improving healthcare
        systems, enhancing environmental sustainability, or increasing access to
        education through technology.
